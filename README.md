### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽŠ My name is Erik. I'm a full-stack web developer that is focused on MERN and AWS. I also work freelance doing web development and consultation.

ðŸ˜„ My homepage is [erikjbrown.tech](https://erikjbrown.tech).

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
Verbose Octo Blog, which is a MERN app for blogs. I'm using it to practice and try out techniques using different concepts I've learned in the past couple years. I will also use it to practice common features and also to get more experience with Redis, Docker, AWS, React, NodeJS, and MongoDB.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
MERN, AWS, my code, etc.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
Just use my email. Look at my homepage for other options.

âš¡ Fun facts:
I have a life outside of coding as well. Some of the things I enjoy include mountain biking, video games, a little exercise, and custom PCs.
